# CLA

A repository to test cla workflows.


## CLA Assistant

### Initial Notes

1. Grant the app permissions by going through workflow at https://cla-assistant.io/
2. Create a Gist with the CLA. This can be a "secret" Gist that is not made searchable but is available to anyone with the link.
   1. Gists are version controlled and CLA Assistant managed the process of making people sign up to any new version.
3. Go to the Dashboard on https://cla-assistant.io/
   1. You may need to refresh the page for it to pick up any newly created repos or Gists.
5. Configure the CLA
   1. Choose a repo
   2. Choose the Gist
   3. Tick "share the Gist" to use one Gist with multiple repos
   4. Leave the options unchanged that trigger a CLA process only once a PR contains a minimum number of changes. IMHO those open us up to poisoned contributions.
6. Once added, people should be able to create PRs on your repo.
